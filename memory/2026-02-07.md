## Phase 0: Solo Foundation

### Completed
- [x] Hardened openclaw.json with security redaction patterns (AES-256-GCM, API key patterns, JWT, Bearer tokens, service secrets)
- [x] Set file permissions: 700 for directories, 600 for openclaw.json
- [x] Created Convex schema (agents, tasks, messages, credentials, auditLog, notifications, documents, activities tables)
- [x] Created Convex encryption utilities for credential management
- [x] Created Convex functions (registerAgent, heartbeat, task CRUD, credential store/retrieve, messaging, notifications)

### Next Steps
- [x] Authenticate with Convex (auth token at .convex-auth-token)
- [x] Deploy Convex schema and functions (using deploy key)
- [x] Set up heartbeat cron job (every 15 minutes)
- [x] Create Mission Control UI (React dashboard)
- [x] Register Cestra as first agent in Convex
- [x] Test end-to-end: heartbeat fires → updates Convex → UI reflects
