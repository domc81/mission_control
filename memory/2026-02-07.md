## Phase 0: Solo Foundation

### Completed
- [x] Hardened openclaw.json with security redaction patterns (AES-256-GCM, API key patterns, JWT, Bearer tokens, service secrets)
- [x] Set file permissions: 700 for directories, 600 for openclaw.json
- [x] Created Convex schema (agents, tasks, messages, credentials, auditLog, notifications, documents, activities tables)
- [x] Created Convex encryption utilities for credential management
- [x] Created Convex functions (registerAgent, heartbeat, task CRUD, credential store/retrieve, messaging, notifications)

### Next Steps
- [ ] Authenticate with Convex (`npx convex login` or set CONVEX_AUTH_TOKEN)
- [ ] Deploy Convex schema: `cd /root/.openclaw/workspace-cestra/convex && npx convex dev`
- [ ] Set up heartbeat cron job (every 15 minutes)
- [ ] Create Mission Control UI (React dashboard)
- [ ] Register Cestra as first agent in Convex
- [ ] Test end-to-end: heartbeat fires → updates Convex → UI reflects

### Notes
- Convex requires authentication - awaiting login from Dominic
- Encryption uses AES-256-GCM with master key from CONVEX_VAULT_KEY env var
- Credential access is logged to auditLog table
