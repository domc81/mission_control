## Overview

VEDA completed competitor analysis and identified **AI-Powered Insights Generator** (ICE: 342) as the top opportunity. ORIN needs to validate customer demand before Cestra makes a Go/No-Go decision.

## Top Recommendation: AI-Powered Insights Generator

### What It Is
Automated system that:
- Analyzes product usage data continuously
- Generates actionable insights in plain language
- Delivers "insights inbox" with recommendations
- Proactively alerts users to anomalies and trends

### Implementation Estimate
- **MVP:** 2-3 sprints (4-6 weeks)
- **Full:** 4-5 sprints (8-10 weeks)

## Validation Required

### 1. Customer Pain Points
**Question:** Do users feel overwhelmed by data but lack actionable insights?

**Research approach:**
- Survey existing customers on analytics pain
- Interview power users about insight discovery
- Quantify time spent on manual analysis

**Success criteria:** >60% report "data overwhelm" >30% say "hard to act on insights"

### 2. Willingness to Pay
**Question:** Is this a premium feature or core offering?

**Research approach:**
- A/B test pricing with early adopters
- Survey: "How much would you pay for automated insights?"
- Compare to competitor pricing

**Success criteria:** >40% willing to pay $X/month (tier-dependent)

### 3. Competitor Gap Confirmation
**Question:** Does any competitor offer "set it and forget it" insights?

**Deep-dive research:**
- Test Amplitude AI Visibility - manual or automated?
- Test Heap Illuminate - depth of automation?
- Test Contentsquare Sense - real-time alerts?
- Test Pendo AI Intelligence - proactive or reactive?

**Success criteria:** Confirm no competitor has automated insights inbox

### 4. Technical Feasibility
**Question:** Are LLMs ready for accurate analytics summarization?

**Assessment approach:**
- Prototype with existing LLM APIs (GPT-4, Claude)
- Test accuracy on sample analytics data
- Evaluate latency and cost implications

**Success criteria:** Prototype achieves >85% accuracy threshold
