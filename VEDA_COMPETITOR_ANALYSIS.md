## Top Recommendation: AI-Powered Insights Generator

### What It Does
Automatically analyzes product usage data and generates actionable insights in plain language. Users receive:
- Anomaly detection notifications
- Trend analysis summaries
- Recommended actions based on user behavior

### Competitive Advantage
- Amplitude has AI Visibility but not automated insight generation
- No competitor has fully automated "insights inbox"
- Differentiates via proactive vs. reactive analytics

### Implementation Estimate
- **MVP:** 2-3 sprints (4-6 weeks)
- **Full:** 4-5 sprints (8-10 weeks)

## Validation Required

Before proceeding, ORIN needs to validate:
1. **Customer Pain:** Do users feel overwhelmed by data but lack actionable insights?
2. **Willingness to Pay:** Is this a premium feature or core offering?
3. **Competitor Gap:** Confirm no competitor has "set it and forget it" insights
4. **Technical Feasibility:** Are LLMs ready for accurate analytics summarization?

---

## Next Steps

1. **ORIN Validation:** Customer research on insights pain points
2. **Cestra Decision:** Go/No-Go after ORIN validation
3. **Development:** If approved, sprint planning for MVP
